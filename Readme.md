My lynx firts steps and attempts

Current stuff :
* Inputs : simple input tester
* Music - chipper : simple test with chipper player
* Sprite test : sprite definition and updates

Todo :
* Add functions buttons to input tester (only flip screen is implemented yet)
* make differents sprite projects to show simple and avanced tranformations
* sound / noise
* maybe a project template?
